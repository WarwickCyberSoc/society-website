In 2013, when we were a punchy little startup, the parallel was fitting. Today, it’s more appropriate than ever. That five-person startup has become a leading tech company—with 500+ bright, inspiring, and hard-working Spooners from over 35 countries. Our category-leading products—including Evernote, Issuu, Meetup, Remini, Splice, StreamYard, and WeTransfer—have been downloaded over a billion times and delight millions of people every day."
