The WMG Cyber Society is proud to announce it's second CTF named **Yet Another CTF**! This is an internal CTF hosted by the society, open to all members on the BSc. Cyber Security course at the University of Warwick. The CTF, unlike [IntakeCTF](/intakectf), will follow the style of a regular CTF, where educational resources, hints, etc. will not be provided, therefore testing your skills! 

**CTF Details:**
- Starts at **2pm 3rd March in IMC246** (pizzas will be available like last time!)
- Ends at **12pm 6th March**
- Maximum of **4 people per team**
- Prizes will be available for the **top 3 teams!**
- Dynamic scoring, meaning the more people who solve a challenge, the less it is worth!
- A variety of challenges available in the following categories:
  - Web
  - Binary Exploitation
  - Forensics
  - Crypto
  - Reversing
  - Cloud
  - OSINT
  - Boot2Root  
   
We highly recommend setting up a Kali VM to participate (it'll save you downloading lots of different tools throughout the event!). You can get premade VMs for [VirtualBox / VMware here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) or if you want to set one up yourself, you can download the [iso here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-bare-metal).

VPN connection will be required to access the site & challenges externally. You do not need a VPN when using the lab machines. Standard CTF rules apply, the full list will be available in our Discord closer to the time.
